Novelist is the idea of a document editor specifically made for authors of literature style books. 
It should allow to edit large documents fast and safe and gives authors possibility to order and navigate their works 
in a way that is intuitive and that makes sense to a creative mind rather then suiting a computer or program.

PRINCIPLES

1. Usability over Visual Appearance
2. Clarity over Convenience
3. Purposefulness over Flexibility
4. Intent over Rigor

PROPERTIES

* Not hidden attributes

FEATURES

* multi visual cut & paste buffers
* reorganization based on structure blocks (not on text level)

SKETCH

It is neither a WYSIWYG editor nor a plain text editor. 
It uses and shows "markups" for styles and layout hints but does not expect the author to "know" or type them.
The hints are visualized to a extend that helps the author organizing and navigating his work.

Two main views: 

* story (left): organizes text into scenes in multiple storylines
* book (right): organizes text into a book edition (multiple parallel are possible)
