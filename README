Novelist is the idea of a document editor specifically made for authors of literature style books. 
It should allow to edit large documents fast and safe and gives athors possibility to order and navigate their works 
in a way that is intuitive and that makes sense to a creative mind rather then suiting a computer or program.

It is neither a WYSIWYG editor nor a plain text editor. 
It uses "markups" for styles and layout hints.
The hints are visualised to the extend that helps the author organizing and navigating his work.
