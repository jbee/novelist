SKETCH

It is neither a WYSIWYG editor nor a plain text editor. 
It uses and shows "markups" for styles and layout hints but does not expect the author to "know" or type them.
The hints are visualised to a extend that helps the author organizing and navigating his work.
Two main views: editing and book. Editing is sectioned in units of narrative while book is sectioned in physical units (pages).

    {book: begin page}
    {story: begin dialog}
